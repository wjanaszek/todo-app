   5. jwt secret: `test` (or whatever you want)
   6. jwt expires in: `36000`
4. Start a PSQL container using `docker run --rm --name todo-docker -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=docker -d -p 5432:5432 postgres`
5. Run `npm install`
6. Run `npm run seed:run`
7. Run `npm start`
8. Application will be available under `localhost:3000`
